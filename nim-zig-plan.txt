These are various considerations about this PR.

1. The Nim compiler is completely embedded in the omni executable.

2. All needed includes (namely, omni_lang) are zipped and embedded in the omni executable. On first
execution, these are unpacked and stored in ~/.local/share/omni (Linux) or ~/Documents/omni (MacOS /
Windows).

3. C compiler: the omni binary can be built two ways. The first one does not contain a C compiler,
and relies on the platform's one. The second one downloads and embeds the zipped version of the Zig
compiler, which is also unpacked and stored in ~/.local/share/omni (Linux) or ~/Documents/omni (MacOS /
Windows).
